Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic disease affecting millions globally. Early detection is crucial for effective management. This model provides a predictive tool based on historical health data to estimate the likelihood of diabetes, facilitating timely intervention.

Getting Started
Clone the Repository:


git clone https://github.com/ranesh88/Diabetes-Prediction-Model.git
cd diabetes-prediction-model
Set Up Virtual Environment:


python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Description
The dataset utilized for this project is publicly available from Kaggle. It encompasses a range of features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, age, and more. The dataset is divided into training and testing subsets to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.

Model Development
The model is developed using Scikit-learn. Several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, are employed to determine the best-performing model. Key aspects of model tuning and evaluation are detailed in model.py.

Performance Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The achieved accuracy is XX%, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting diabetes. Comprehensive results and comparisons are documented in results.md.

Usage Guide
Run the Prediction Script:


python predict.py
Input Parameters: Follow the instructions provided in predict.py for input data formatting.
